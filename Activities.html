            <h2>Reptile House</h2>
            <p class="pact">Our reptile house holds all kind of reptiles from tiny house reptiles to crocodiles. The reptile house was a very early project started by the Zoo. Initially it was meant to hold wild crocodiles captured around the country which are believed to be a threat to humans.</p>
            <p class="pact"> Afterwards, due to the increase in demand for the crocodiles the Zoo decided on building its reptile house. Whether you are an enthusiast for reptiles or if you just want to get an upclose picture with a crocodile the reptile house is definitely worth visiting. There will be active photographers in the reptile house to take pictures and capture the memories you make.</p>
