            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="description">Growing larger than Lions, the Tiger is the biggest member of the cat family. The tiger is one of the most muscular looking cats in the family. Tigers generally weight about 450 pounds.</p>
            <p class="description">The cat is usually three feet tall with teeth about four inches long and claws at about two inches. Tigers also have tiny teeth like structures on their tongues. If a Tiger licks a human on the skin the teeth like structures on their tongues can easily rip the skin right off a human. This is not an animal to be bothered.</p>
            <p class="description">They are easily distinguishable through their long tails. However, their most distinguishable feature is their black stripes on their luxorious orangish coat.</p>

        <h2>Social Habits</h2>
        <p class="description">Tigers are very powerful predators who usually hunt alone. They usually hunt animals such as deer and antelope. Tigers are habitually night hunters as they prefer to hunt in stealth. They are usually able to grab an animal and pull it off its feet with their powerful teeth. Tigers usually eat around 60 POUNDS OF MEAT PER NIGHT!</p>
        <p class="description">Tigers are very territorial animals. Tigers can sense if there are any other Tigers intruding in their territory as Tigers mark trees with urine and scratches to mark their territory similar to regular house cats. Furthermore, Tigers also love water and love to swim unlike most other cats. </p>
        <p class="description">Female tigers usually give birth to litters of 3-4 cubs and she will care for these cubs for a period of one and a half years. These cubs will quadruple in size in the first month after birth.</p>
